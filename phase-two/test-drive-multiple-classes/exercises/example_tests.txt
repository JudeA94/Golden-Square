Diary
when initialised it should create an empty array
check that showing all on empty diary show empty array
reading time for an empty diary should return 0
find best entry for empty diary should throw error

DiaryEntry
when initialised it creates an instance of diary entry with title and contents
when title is called on the instance it returns the title when title is called on contents it returns the contents
count words splits entry contents into array of words and counts them
reading time takes wpm and returns reading time of this instance of diary entry
reading time throws error if given parameter <= 0
reading chunk wpm <= 0 causes a fail
when given a text readable within minutes it returns full text
text not readable within given minutes it just returns words readable within time
next time its called it returns the next chunk
it restarts after ending (either exactly on the end or if you could read beyond in given time)

Integration
adding instances of entries calling all returns an array their names
count words should return the total number of words in all the contents of the diary entries
reading time returns the estimate for the reading time for all diary entries (calling reading time for each)
returns the diary entry that has the most words but still less than wpm*minutes
